# mbedcrypto
`mbedcrypto` is a portable, small, easy to use, feature rich and fast
`c++14` library for cryptography based on fantastic and clean
[mbedtls](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls)<sup>[note](#mbedtls)</sup>
<sup>[note](#cryptography)</sup>.

a sister project for `Qt5` developers is available as
[qpolarssl](https://github.com/azadkuh/qpolarssl), although `mbedcrypto` is
newer and has more features with smaller footprint and can be configured to
support `QByteArray` through the api.


for more information see [wiki](https://github.com/azadkuh/mbedcrypto/wiki) page.

## features and highlights

- *small size*: the `mbedcrypto` is less than `250KB` in size (as single shared
 library and stripped under Linux and OS X) with all *predefined* algorithms.
 it can be easily embedded into your service or application.
- *easy to use*: although cryptography<sup>[note](#cryptography)</sup> is
 complex and complicated, `mbedcrypto` hides most of the complexities, tries to
 be easy to use and hard to misuse.
- *portable*: needs an standard `c++14` compiler and compliant `stl`,
 compiled and tested by:
  - `g++ 5.x+ / 6+` under `linux`
  - `clang 3.6+` under `os x`
  - `mingw 5.x+` under `msys2` (windows 8.1)
  - `msvc 2015` community edition under `windows 7`
- *low dependency*:
  - the `mbedtls`<sup>[note](#mbedtls)</sup> as underlying cryptography engine,
   is the only mandatory dependency.
  - [catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch): only for unit testing.
  - `cmake` for building the library and the unit test app.
- *high+low level*: both high level (c++ objects / exception) and low level (c
 pointer / error code) functions are available.
- *highly configurable*: to add or remove the algorithms, simply change `cmake`
 build options. see [build options](#build-options)
- *optional suppport for Qt5*: optional support for **Qt5**'s `QByteArray` is also
available.

## setup

### setup using Bash

```git clone``` the repository as you usually would. Then go to your terminal and execute the following command to download all dependencies:

```bash
./update-dependencies.sh
```

### setup using git submodules

When using ```git clone```, add the ```--recurse-submodules``` flag to the command.
This way, the dependencies will be downloaded aswell.

> Dependencies are downloaded using Git's submodules. See the [manual](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more info.

## build

> Before building the library, you need to be in the top-level of the `mbedcrypto` repository.

Build the `mbedcrypto` library using CMake in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

> the `mbedcrypto` library and the companion unit test app would be built into
> `xbin` directory.

## notes

### cryptography
[cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_cryptography) is both
complex and complicated, it requires a vast knowledge of mathematics, concepts,
principles, algorithms, standards, conventions, continuous investigation of
attacks, ...

> As cryptography is mostly used to protect sensitive data, writing a library
> for it is a daunting task and difficult by any factor.

So instead of writing a library from scratch, `mbedcrypto` stands on the
shoulders of giants, `mbedtls` is this case.

### mbedtls
Although [mbedtls](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls) is mostly a `TLS/SSL`
library for embedded devices, it has already implemented the most famous and
widely used cryptographic algorithms and actively developed and maintained.

Arguably `mbedtls` has cleaner code than `openssl`, it's easier to read, use
and maintain, and it has been designed for efficiency and portability from
scratch (for embedded devices), and has many advantages over `openssl` like as
readability, size, compiling and setup, … to name a few.


## disclaimer

- implementing an easy-to-use, lightweight and portable `c++` library for
cryptography are the main purpose of `mbedcrypto`.
- there are many more algorithms in cryptographic libraries, the focus of
`mbedcrypto` is on the most important or widely used algorithms, tries to be
simple and not to bloat your application.
- as mentioned in [notes](#notes), the cryptography can be divided into several
areas of study and best practices, I'm not a guru nor a specialist in this
field.


> If you have any ideas, critiques, suggestions or whatever you want to call
> it, please open an issue. I'll be happy to hear from you what you'd see in
> this lib. I think about all suggestions, and I try to add those that make
> sense.
